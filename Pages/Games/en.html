Hello! I am Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, I want to offer you an idea for a site with games - How to hack games using olydbg.
</span>
<br> <br> <hr> <br>
Another way:
<span style = "font-style: italic;">
Hello! I am Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov want to offer you a ready-made text on ideas for your site on games. <br> Text: <br> To hack games using olydbg (such a program) you need: <br> <ul>
<li> olydbg herself </li>
<li> A password-protected game or program </li>
<li> Desire </li>
</ul> <br>
It is advisable to know the assembly language, but if you do not know it, then it's okay. <br>
About a password-protected program or game. You can write a readable application that is password protected. <br>
If you donâ€™t know programming languages, then download the program <span style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Game Protector </span> It is absolutely free. <br> Download it, select the application and click Protect. <br>
After all this, open olydbg. And we select the password-protected application already there. Launch the application that is password protected and enter any password. And we see the text for example "Invalid Password", open olydbg and press Ctrl + F, write "Invalid Password". We have a window with lines. Press F2 by selecting this line and launch the application from olydbg. We write any password and see the same thing. We contact olydbg. And we see the real password, and the one that we entered.
